            story=_ "Journal of Erazin, Mage of Light. 450 YW
			
I have begun my journey, despite the mockery of my associates. I will not return to the Great Academy unless I return in triumph.
			
For years now, we have heard tales of strange, human-like dragons, yet the rumours are wildly inconsistent. Do they truly spawn from living lava? Do they murder half of each brood to teach ruthlessness? Or are these silly fables of false historians?
			
I must find out for myself. I am journeying towards the north mountains."

            story=_ "Success! I have been admitted into a tribe of Drakes. Their leader, Terrik, has been more than gracious. I have discovered that much of the rumours concerning the drakes are false.
			
Though their society is savage, their intelligence is perhaps the equal of ours. They are divided into castes, and moving between castes is forbidden. The drakes spend much of their time in hunting (to satisfy their vast appetite) and metal work (for accoutrements of war and for beauty).
			
I have asked Terrik if there is a caste like mine, historians. He promises that he will show me tomorrow."

            story=_ "A surprise! They did indeed have a historian. I was shown into a back tunnel, where, to my surprise, I was confronted with an ancient lizard-woman of a different species. A saurian! The rumours of an alliance between the two species seem to be true.
			
This old woman, by the name of Zlela, told me the Drakes' story of their origin. Each tribe has its own story, she says. But the story of this tribe began, she said, a long, long time ago."
