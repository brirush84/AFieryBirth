            story=_ "The historian of the Drakes continued with her story.
			
After the battle, she said, the dragon was weaker than ever. The old woman said that one of her ancestors, a Saurian by the name of Szel, was the leader of a troop of her people that worshipped and honored the dragon. They lived near the mountain and relied on the dragon to protect them from their enemies.

Unaware of the difficulties the dragon faced within, the band of saurians faced problems of their own."
